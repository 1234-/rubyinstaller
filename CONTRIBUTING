RubyInstaller is a project that provides binaries for Windows and a
complementary set of tools to make it more easy use Ruby on Windows.

However, it doesn't patch or alter Ruby source code and by that it cannot
modify Ruby beyond packaging.

Bugs accepted are those related to the Installers, Development Kit, compilation
options or missing documentation. Other bug reports fit better to Ruby's own
bug tracker:

http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/

If you're not sure if your bug is directly RubyInstaller or Ruby specific,
please use our Google Groups to ask these questions:
